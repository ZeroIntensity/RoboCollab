## Notes
### Known Bugs
This project overall is pretty buggy and untested atm, so don't expect this to cover much.
- Account linking is currently broken (hence why the core part of it is commented out)
- The `error` function requires a `return` statement or else the command continues. I'm sure i've forgot to put this in some places, so some comands might be broken because of that.
